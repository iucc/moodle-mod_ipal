This files describes changes in the ipal code.

=== 2.9 (but keeping the program running in Moodle 2.8 and 2.7) ===

* There have been changes in classes that can be used from the quiz module. 
    class quiz_questionbank_view no longer exitst.
    This version puts in an if statement to take care the change of classes. 
    Line 251 in mod/ipal/edit.php looks for the new class.
    if (class_exists('mod_quiz\question\bank\custom_view')) {
* Take care of the deprecation on the function add_intro_editor() through line 85 in /mod/ipal/mod_form
    if (method_exists($this, 'standard_intro_elements')) {
* Made the question stamp for the generic questions unique by creating each stamp individually in /mod/ipal/quiz/ipal_genericq_create.php
* Create the utility to use ipal to eaisy take attendance in the Moodle attendance module.
    (Thanks to the Moodle team at the University of Jerusalem for help with the design of this utility.)
    Ipal now looks to see if the attendance module has been added to the Moodle site.
    If it has the teacher then has the option to create "Attendance Questions."
    If the teacher clicks to select this option, the list of Attendance Sessions for that course is displayed.
    If the teacher then selects one or more of the sessions, ipal creates an "Attendance Question" for each
        of the selected Attendance Sessions. These "Attendance Questions" can then be added to ipal instances.
    When the teacher sends an "Attendance Question" during a polling session, a unique attendance code is displayed
        to the teacher. The teacher lets the students who are present know this unique code. The "Attendance Question"
        asks the students to submit the attendance code as their answer to the "Attendance Question."
    At any time the teacher can click a button beside any "Attendance Question." The ipal program then parses the student
        answers for that question. All students who submitted the attendance code as their answer are marked present.
        The ipal program notifies the teacher with a list of those students marked present. The teacher can change
        the attendance record by hand at any time.
    
    + Modify the /mod/ipal/edit.php script to display the option for adding "Attendance Questions."
    + Modify the /mod/ipal/locallib.php script to provide the needed functions.
    + Add some of the new text strings into the /mod/ipal/lang/en/ipal.php script.
    + Add a new page where teachers add the "Attendance Questions", /mod/ipal/attendancequestion_ipal.php
    + Add a page to let the teacher know what has been updated in the attendance session, /mod/ipal/attendancerecorded_ipal.php
    
* Update the backup and restore utilities to handle questions correctly, even when restoring to a different Moodle site.
    + Add in the table ipal_slots to the database with both the install and upgrade function.
        This required modification to /mod/ipal/db/install.xml and /mod/ipal/db/upgrade.php
        This makes some of the ipal handling of questions similar to the handling in the quiz module.        
    + Change all the backup and restore scripts.

* Improve the display of questions from the question bank to use the utilities from the quiz module.
    (Thanks to Paul Nicholls for this improvement in the code.)
    + Changes in the following scripts:
        - /mod/ipal/classes/bank/search/condition_unused.php
        - /mod/ipal/edit.php
        - /mod/ipal/editlib.php
        - /mod/ipal/styles.css
    
+ Added options to the ipal module
    (Thanks to Paul Nicholls for this improvement in the code.)
    + Administrators can turn off sending data to compadre for improved analytics.
    + Administrators can turn off allowing teachers to get questions from compadre
    + Administrators can turn off the creation of the default generic questions.
    + These changes required changes to the code in the following ipal scripts:
        - /mod/ipal/settings.php
        - /mod/ipal/upgrade.php
        - /mod/ipal/edit.php
